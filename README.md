# Hybrid-Images
Hybrid Images: Mini Project 1 of the Computer Vision Course Offered in Spring 2022 @ Zewail City

The project is adopted from a similar course in Brown University.
In hybrid images, specific frequencies tend to dominate at particular distances. For instance, high frequencies dominate when the object is closer, while lower frequencies become more dominant when it is farther away. 

By using a Gaussian blur, we can create a low-pass filtered equivalent of the image and demonstrate the effect of hybrid images as shown:
